##COBS metaG multivariate walkthrough

We are going to walkthrough some basic multivariate analysis that can help with analyzing metagenomes and any other multivariate dataset.

Our goals are to:

1. Learn basic multivariate analyses

2. Use R both remotely and locally

3. Produce publication-ready visualizations

4. Generate multivariate statistics

##Step 1##
- Navigate to anl5 and the path
``
ssh anl5
cd /mnt/data1/rjw_COBS_analysis/COBS_all_metaG_analysis/data
``
Now we will run R by simply typing `R`

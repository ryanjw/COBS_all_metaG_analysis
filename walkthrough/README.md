##COBS metaG multivariate walkthrough

We are going to walkthrough some basic multivariate analysis that can help with analyzing metagenomes and any other multivariate dataset.

Our goals are to:

1. Learn basic multivariate analyses

2. Use R both remotely and locally

3. Produce publication-ready visualizations

4. Generate multivariate statistics

##Getting Started##
- Navigate to anl5 and the path
```
ssh anl5
cd /mnt/data1/rjw_COBS_analysis/COBS_all_metaG_analysis/data
```
Now we will run R by simply typing ``R``

We are now in a remote R environment.  Think of this as your 'data crunching space', while we will use R on our local machine as our 'studio'.

##Reading in the data##

Look at the dataset before going into R (in other words type ``quit()`` if you are currently in the R environment).  There are a variety of ways to do this.

What do you notice about this file?  How is it organized?  How is it delimited?
